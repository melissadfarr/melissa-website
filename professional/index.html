<br />

As an assistant, I thrive on innovating and implementing new ideas - technologically and interpersonally - that increase efficacy. The heart of a sucessful company is its ability to creatively and effeciently tackle any new problem and to improve on ways to handle existing ones. <br />
<br />

During 2012 and 2013, I was assistant to the director of the <a href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu"> Geophyiscal Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>. I designed and implemented a digital filing system for tens of thousands of documents that needed to be easily retrievable. I effectively turned multiple rooms of large filing cabinets into a searchable and organized system. I believe that creativity and the ability to apply that to problems are two of the most vital qualities of an assistant, and that is what I bring to the table. <br /> <br />
Prior to working at UAF, I tutored undergraduate students for both North Carolina State University and The Princeton Review. At NCSU, I assisted students with research papers, presentations, and exam study in courses across the humanities and social sciences. While with Princeton Review, my focus was preparing students for the GRE. In both positions I was evaluated according to the performance of my students, and I received a promotion at NCSU on this basis. Many of the skills that made me an effective tutor - such as the ability to communicate information clearly and succinctly - also allow me to excel as an assistant. <br />  
<br />
In addition to tutoring, I held a research assistant position at NCSU. My two primary tasks were to assist in the management of the <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/linguistics/ncllp/"> NCLLP</a> / <a href="http://ncslaap.lib.ncsu.edu/about.php">NCSLAAP</a> database and to organize weekly departmental seminars. I added and modified sociophonetic interviews, transcripts, and supporting documentation through the MySQL-based NCSLAAP system. This information was used by researchers and educators throughout the country. I also arranged speakers from universities across the region, serving as the point of contact and the organizer of travel.<br />
<br />
While an undergraduate, I was employed by the <a href="http://iah.unc.edu/"> Insitute of the Arts and Humanities </a> at UNC as a student assistant for more than two years and was given incresing responsibility over time. My duties there including overseeing catering, creating promotional material for large conferences, and scheduling meetings between the director, the chancellor, and the Board of Regents.
