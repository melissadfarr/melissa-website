I received a BA from UNC-Chapel Hill (Linguistics, 2010) and completed year one of graduate school (2010-2011) at North Carolina State University. My research focused on sociophonetic linguistics and discourse analysis and heavily utilized <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/linguistics/ncllp/">The North Carolina Language and Life Project database (NCLLP).</a> I left the program in 2011 with the intention of completing it at a later time. <br /> 
<br />
While an undergraduate, I presented a paper at <a href="http://www.secol.org/conferences/noconference/schedule/abstracts/kohn%20and%20farr.html">The SouthEastern Conference for Linguistics (SECOL LXXVI)</a>. As a graduate student, I presented papers at ASU (Linguistics/TESOL Symposium 17) and NCSU (AEGS 2). In addition to my research, I maintained a 4.0 GPA while in the NCSU linguistics graduate program. <br />
<br /> 
Two of my responsiblities as a funded research assistant in the program were to assist in the maintainence of the NCLLP database and schedule weekly 'brown bag' seminars. I have included more about my professional experience at NCSU <a href="http://melissafarr.me/professional/"> here.</a> <br />
