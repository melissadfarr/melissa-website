I am above all a curious person, and that leads to me to ask the question of anything that I am involved with: How can it be improved? As a linguist, I was concerned with understanding and overcoming the societal barriers constructed by language use and dialect. As an avid traveler, I am always looking for the best travel arrangements - from transportation to new experiences. <br />
<br /> 
I moved to Alaska in 2012. When you think of moving somewhere 5,000 miles away, your first impulse is to fly. I spent my college years traveling all over the country on Amtrak and Greyhound, though, and I learned that half the fun of going somewhere is getting there. My first thought was to drive from North Carolina to Alaska via the ALCAN (a highway through Canada to Alaska). Given its reputation for tiny, treacherous mountain paths, though, I figured perhaps that was not my best idea. I decided to take a train across the country, spend a few days in Washington state, take the Alaska Ferry to Valdez, and then drive from there. I've never made a more fabulous decision in my life. <br />
<br />
I spent almost a week sleeping outside on the top deck of a giant ferry, watching the whales and glaciers pass. I met people from all walks of life - from newly stationed servicemen to old-timers going back to their fishing boats in Juneau. During a layover in Ketchikan, I went to go see a preserve of wild bald eagles. There is nothing like Alaska, although I will warn you that the winter wind in Valdez is second in miserable weather experiences only to a winter of consistent -40 F temperatures in Fairbanks. <br />
<br />
I believe in exploration and stumbling into amazing things while taking the creative route. You know exactly what you're going to get when you uphold the status quo, but if you step beyond that and take a chance, you might just find the most wonderful and unexpected things. At the worst, if you get seasick, you can always spend a few days playing Civilization on your laptop. Can't beat that. <br />
